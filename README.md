# Torq

Torq is a node management tool for large lightning network nodes.

![All Tests](https://github.com/lncapital/torq/actions/workflows/test-on-push.yml/badge.svg)

## Quick start

To install Torq run:

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://torq.sh)"
```

You do not need sudo/root to run this and you can check the contents of the installation script here: https://torq.sh

## Permissions

Since Torq is built to manage your node, it needs most/all permissions to be fully functional. However, if you want to
be extra careful you can disable some permissions that are not strictly needed.

Torq does not for now need the ability to create new macaroon or stop the LND daemon,

    lncli bakemacaroon \
        invoices:read \
        invoices:write \
        onchain:read \
        onchain:write \
        offchain:read \
        offchain:write \
        address:read \
        address:write \
        message:read \
        message:write \
        peers:read \
        peers:write \
        info:read \
        uri:/lnrpc.Lightning/UpdateChannelPolicy \
        --save_to=torq.macaroon

Here is an example of a macaroon that can be used if you want to prevent all actions that sends funds from your node:

    lncli bakemacaroon \
        invoices:read \
        invoices:write \
        onchain:read \
        offchain:read \
        address:read \
        address:write \
        message:read \
        message:write \
        peers:read \
        peers:write \
        info:read \
        uri:/lnrpc.Lightning/UpdateChannelPolicy \
        --save_to=torq.macaroon
